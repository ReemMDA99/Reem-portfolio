# MY PORTFOLIO
This is a little bit about me. I made a portfolio website as per the given criteria in Challenge 2.

## Project Goals:
-To create an impressive and attractive portfolio which will help for career develpoment and job search.
-Helps viewers to know more about myself.
-To list my qualifications, workexperiences and my projects.

## Project Accepntance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
